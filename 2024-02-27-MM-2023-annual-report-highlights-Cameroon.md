The beginning of December members from different Missing Maps organisations came together in Yaoundé, Cameroon to host the annual Missing Maps meeting and to attend the State of the Map Africa conference.

The State of the map Africa 2023 conference provided the perfect opportunity to meet and engage with our partners and mapping friends from Africa. After all, it is the continent we engaged in with mapping activities the most through the Missing Maps initiative throughout the years, since its foundation in 2014. With over 200 attendees with representatives from large international organisations such as WRI and FAO, to technology giants such as Meta and TomTom, but especially the high representation from grass roots level African mapping communities made it the perfect location for Missing Maps member organisations to be. 

State of the Map Africa was a true inspiration for all who participated. Repeating themes throughout the conference were: 
- Mapping for climate resilience and positive environmental impact
- Improvement of health services through mapping
- Women’s and youth engagement in mapping
- Mapping for disaster risk management and resilience
- Building sustainable mapping communities

All topics that we care a lot about as humanitarians! 

We therefore want to thank the organising committee, sponsors and participants to make this such a successful event.

Prior to the State of the Map conference we hosted at the same venue the Missing Maps annual meeting which was a great way to regroup on priorities, and acknowledge and celebrate achievements amongst member organisations. With members from four different organisations joining in person, and representatives of 10 member organisations joining online, the discussions were intense and productive at the same time as we discussed year 9 of our collaboration.Topics on the table for discussion included the perception of Missing Maps by the public, 10-years celebration, and the engagement of youth in Missing Maps.

One outcome from our annual meeting we would love to share with the whole Missing Maps community. We wrote for the first time ever a Missing Maps annual report: [MM Annual Report 2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fi87_lxtBJLscgLeEnD8LYuyxQYT7oDG/view?usp=drive_link)

The report gives a summary of the 2023 Missing Maps activities, successes, challenges and plans for the upcoming year per member organisation. At the end it gives you as well some successful collaboration highlights between Missing Maps member organisations.

Please celebrate with us, you were an essential part of it!  

We are looking forward to the next global State of the Map which will be hosted in Nairobi, Kenya in September 2024. 2024 also marks the 10th anniversary of Missing Maps, stay tuned for news about upcoming celebrations!
