## MapSwipe change detection analysis in response to Cyclone Batsirai Madagascar 2022 

To respond to this cyclone emergency in Madagascar, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) used a new innovative MapSwipe method developed by the Heidelberg University.

#### Introduction  

Between 5 and 22 February 2022, tropical cyclones Batsirai and Emnati hit Madagascar’s east coast, destroying, and flooding numerous medical and non-medical sites. It is estimated more than 300,000 people have been affected.  

Madagascar has faced numerous extreme weather events in recent years. Southern Madagascar before the cyclone was still recovering from the effect of an exceptionally severe drought, which caused alarming levels of malnutrition.  

In response to the cyclones, MSF teams began providing healthcare to areas most affected however their challenges on the ground in identifying areas which have been affected by the cyclone through flooding and building damage.  

One major challenge for MSF to respond to this emergency was to identify specific areas which have been flooded or damaged.

#### MapSwipe 

 
MapSwipe is an open-source mobile app to make mapping around the world more coordinated and efficient. It was created by the Heidelberg Institute of Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT). In the original MapSwipe ‘build area’ mission type, users swipe through satellite images and tap an imagery tile once when they’ve located particular features such as buildings. 

In the spring 2021, MSF created six projects of this type to identify where buildings were in rural areas to help plan its activities in southern Madagascar. With the results, MSF set up HOT Tasking Manager projects and with Missing Maps volunteers mapped buildings and residential areas throughout the following months. 


#### MapSwipe New Project Type (Change Detection)  


A new project type allows detection of flooding and building damage to be identified remotely. 

This new function allows users to compare two satellite images (for this context one image before the cyclone and one after the cyclone) and indicate areas of change. For the context of this emergency users were asked if flooding and building damage could be seen. 


#### How this new Project type was used in Madagascar 


This new function allows users to compare two satellite images and indicate areas of change. For this context, one image before the cyclone and one after the cyclone were used and users were asked if flooding and building damage could be seen.   

This new project type was used in two areas - Mananjary and Mahanoro, East Madagascar which were heavily affected by the cyclone. The users compared two satellite images, one before the cyclone and one after the cyclone. 

Once the projects were created each task only took a couple of days to be completed which allowed a quick response to the cyclone. Once individual tasks were completed geo analysis was performed on the MapSwipe data to individual buildings and places of interest which have been affected by either flooding or damage. 

These maps were sent to the Head of Mission of these projects to then be used to plan humanitarian assistance to the affected areas.
