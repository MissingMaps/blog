# Congratulations HOTOSM on TED Audacious Grant

**15 years ago** a gentleman in the UK had an nearly impossible idea. He wanted to create a free and open map of the world. [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) was born.

**10 years ago** a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti brought about the  [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](http://hotosm.org/). HOTOSM as it would later be known helped humanitarians understand and work with communities in a way never thought possible with the existing map services of the day.

**7 years ago** [Typhoon Haiyan](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan) hit the Philippines and HOTOSM was organized and creating maps of the potential area even before the Super Typhoon made landfall. The resulting data in OpenStreetMap became [the map for all humanitarians](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/how-online-mapmakers-are-helping-the-red-cross-save-lives-in-the-philippines/281366/) on the ground and sped up aid deliveries by over one month.

**6 years ago** [Ebola](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2014_West_Africa_Ebola_Response) ravaged West Africa killing over 10,000 people. HOTOSM again rose to the challenge to fill in the gaps and blank spots on the map. Médecins Sans Frontières, Red Cross, and other organizations were not only reliant on the data but helping to create it in coordination with HOTOSM volunteers.

**6 years ago** HOTOSM, American Red Cross, British Red Cross, and Médecins Sans Frontières got together to form [Missing Maps](https://missingmaps.org) with the intention of mapping the worlds vulnerable people who were literally missing from the map. Missing Maps brought over 100,000 new mappers from around the world to continually contribute to OpenStreetMap. 

Missing Maps was founded with two goals:

_1.  To map the most vulnerable places in the developing world, in order that international and local NGOs and individuals can use the maps and data to better respond to crises affecting the areas.
2.  To support  [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/), specifically the  [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](http://hotosm.org/), in developing technologies, skills, workflows, and communities._

**5 years ago** These goals were put to the test almost immediatly when a [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_Nepal_earthquake) struck the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. HOTOSM [volunteers](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mapping-nepal-after-the-earthquake) supported the local mapping community in Nepal alongside volunteers from Missing Maps and other coordinating non-profits. 

HOTOSM is small organization with fantastic volunteers. It is not to dissimilar from the early days of some of the world most important non-profits. Missing Maps is proud of its small role to support HOTOSM. Missing Maps and its members have always seen a strong return on our investment to support and build HOTOSM. 

**TODAY** HOTOSM announced they have received a [TED Audacious](https://audaciousproject.org/ideas/2020/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team) grant to fund the core operations for five year to put **1 billion people on the map**. This grant will make possible the next phase of work for HOTOSM and the greater OpenStreetMap project. It will allow the map to better relect our world and the people in it. It will build equity for all people. Congratulations to HOTOSM and to each and every volunteer and person who played a role in creating the next phase and supporting HOTOSM to take this next *audacious* step.

Go read HOTOSM's [post and initial 5-year plan](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/audacious/) to get involved.
