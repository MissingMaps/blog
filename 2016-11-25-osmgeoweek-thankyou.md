Thank you for your incredible efforts organizing this year's OSM GeoWeek! In total 140 public and 150 private events took place in 42 countries.  We made 1 million edits and added 861,865 buildings and 145,030 km of roads to OSM. Thanks to your hard work, almost 4,000 new mappers joined the OSM community!

If you would like to share pictures, please add them with a short blurb to HOT’s Flickr located here.
