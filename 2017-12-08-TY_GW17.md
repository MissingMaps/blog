## Thank you! Geo-Week 2017 was a huge success!

Hello Mappers,

Thank you for your incredible efforts organizing this year's OSM GeoWeek! In total, we had 230 public events in 48 countries. We had almost 100 extra events this year and increased our country footprint by 6 countries. Together, we added 292,856 features, which is about double what we accomplished in 2016.  What amazing accomplishments! One of my favorite quotes comes from Geneva, where a participant checked in with her event organizer to let her know that she found that “Mapping was mesmerizing and relaxing” and had spent that next weekend practicing her new skill! 

We would love to hear about your event to help make next year even bigger and better. If you have time, please fill out this [form] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKG9bYHIcPdHSnT3Yf700LC0evzCqs-ihI5rkjaAopdcCMOg/viewform) to let us know what went well, what went poorly, and if you have any lessons you’d like to pass on to your fellow organizers. If you would like to share pictures, please add them with a short blurb to HOT’s Flickr located [here](https://www.flickr.com/groups/hotosm/pool/).

It's a great idea to follow-up with your participants (if you haven't already). Here are some helpful reminders you can include:

•	If possible, you can be a part of HOT's 2018 Crowdfunding Campaign to #mapthedifference. Give any amount to [HOT's campaign] (https://donate.hotosm.org) - On the site, you can set up a personal Fundraising page to share with your mapathon networks and supporters.
•	Sign up for the [HOT Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/bC7JBj)
