## American Red Cross grants OpenStreetMap $25,000

American Red Cross is very excited to announce a USD $25,000 grant to OpenStreetMap Foundation for a hardware purchase to support the ongoing resilience of the OSM infrastructure. The funds were allocated towards the purchase and provisioning of a ‘hot’ backup database failover server – which has been purchased and is currently humming along doing its important job! This trail-blazing contribution will ensure that we can recover from site failures quickly and with the minimum amount of disruption for those editing the map. This is a big step forward in platform resiliency that we otherwise would not have been able to make at this time.

American Red Cross and OpenStreetMap

The American Red Cross has steadily ramped up our support for OpenStreetMap since our [first mapathon in to map communities in Uganda in 2012](http://www.redcross.org/news/article/New-Mapping-Technologies-for-the-Developing-World). Identifying OSM as a source of up-to-date map data crucial to their international disaster field operations, we've quickly developed into a major contributor to OSM and support of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). Most recently through the Missing Maps initiative, to which around 10% of all OSM map contributions can now be attributed. The American Red Cross also supports OpenStreetMap through [app development](http://posm.io) and sponsorship of [State of the Map](http://sotm.us) conferences.

If you are interested in the technical specifications of this [new server](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/eddie.openstreetmap.org/).

We hope more organizations which use OSM data will be inspired to strengthen the OSMF infrastructure and support our great project! If you are interested in donating to the OpenStreetMap Foundation, please get email them at  board@osmfoundation.org.
