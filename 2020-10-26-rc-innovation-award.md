The Red Cross Humanitarian Technology Awards (IV Edition) are awards that promote the humanitarian use of technology to build a better world and are awarded to developments which promote the humanitarian use of technology.

The Missing Maps Project members are delighted to have been awarded the Cruz Roja Award, and are proud to stand alongside the other award winners, whose projects, ideas and prototypes demonstrate the power of emerging technology for humanitarian action.

We are incredibly honoured to be part of a passionate, humanitarian network of mappers who have created to this technology and community.

This 15th — 21st November is [OpenStreetMap GeoWeek](https://osmgeoweek.org/index.html), bringing together community groups, map enthusiasts, humanitarians and others to celebrate geography. During the week we’ll create maps with OpenStreetMap (OSM), the free, open source map of the world that the Missing Maps Project contributes to and uses to build maps for programmes and preparedness.

Together with IFRC regional offices this OSMGeoWeek, we’re also aiming to expand and grow awareness of the Missing Maps Project, humanitarian mapping, awareness of open map data, and build mappers within the Red Cross Red Crescent movement globally.
There’ll be mapathon events, information sessions and skill sharing sessions among other activities! Find out about the public events and sign up on the Missing Maps or OSMGeoWeek websites or even submit your own event!
