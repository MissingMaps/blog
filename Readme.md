### Adding Blog Posts

Blog posts are added to the [Missing Maps site](http://missingmaps.org) by adding a new file here. Click on the Create new file botton on top of this page and a new file will open.

First name your file with the following naming conventions YYYY-MM-DD-[title-of-post].md For instance the first blog post is named 2016-05-05-intro-to-missing-maps.md

Next copy and paste the following to the top of your new file. This 'front matter' is important for the page meta data and so that it will build correctly.

After having adapted the font matter, start writing your blogpost.

To format the text you will need to use Markdown. Find [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) a guide. You could also check out how other blog posts look like. 

The images of your article should be named following `missingmaps-blog_YYYYMMDD_my-file-name.extension`, and should be resized to an appropriately small size. Banner images should have the hue/saturation reduced. 

Images should be added to the [MissingMaps/img repository](https://github.com/MissingMaps/img) in the `images/` directory. 

Once your images are in the img repository, you will have to add a link to the image into your text. Use the below formatting for this. 

````
<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MissingMaps/img/main/images/missingmaps-blog_YYYYMMDD_my-file-name.extension">
<p class="caption">write here the caption of your image</p>
</figure>
````
 See below an example.

Once all the edits are done, click Commit new file. The file will be reviewed by one of the administrators and will be added on the blog page of the Missing Maps website.
